---

## Phase 0 – Foundations (Day 1–2)

1. **Define business goals**

-   Decide primary goals: inbound calls and WhatsApp quote requests.
-   Decide primary geography: **Lagos as the core city**, plus **nationwide Nigeria coverage**.

2. **Define target audiences**

    - Homeowners building/renovating roofs.
    - Contractors and builders.
    - Commercial/industrial property owners.

3. **Clarify positioning & USP**
    - Note what makes your aluminum roofing sheets special: thickness, coating, warranty, price, installation network, speed, etc.
    - Positioning statement for this brand (Gods Promise Aluminium):
        - "Gods Promise Aluminium is a Lagos-based aluminium roofing and building products company serving customers across Nigeria. We deliver durable, rust-resistant roofing systems tailored to the Nigerian climate, with simple WhatsApp quoting and reliable nationwide delivery so homeowners and contractors can roof with confidence."
    - Core USP pillars:
        - Built for Nigerian climate: gauges and coatings selected for heat, humidity and coastal areas.
        - Nationwide reach from Lagos: supply and delivery to major cities and states in Nigeria.
        - Fast, simple WhatsApp quotes: clear pricing per sheet and per square metre.
        - Consistent quality and records: accurate thickness, colour consistency, and documented orders.
        - Support for contractors: advice on sheet selection, quantity calculation and installation basics.

## Phase 1 – Site Structure & Key Pages (Day 2–3)

4. **Decide main site sections**

    - Core pages:
        - Home
        - About
        - Aluminum Roofing Sheets (main category page)
        - Product detail pages (per profile/thickness/finish)
        - Applications/Use cases (e.g. Residential, Industrial, Warehouse, School, Church)
        - Pricing / Get a Quote
        - Gallery / Projects
        - Contact
    - Content/Docs:
        - Resources / Guides / FAQs
        - Blog

5. **Create a simple URL map** (even in a spreadsheet or note)

    - Example structure:
        - `/` – Home
        - `/about` – About
        - `/aluminum-roofing-sheets` – Main category page
        - `/aluminum-roofing-sheets/trapezoidal-profile`
        - `/aluminum-roofing-sheets/step-tile-profile`
        - `/applications/residential-roofing`
        - `/applications/industrial-roofing`
        - `/pricing` or `/get-quote`
        - `/gallery`
        - `/contact`
        - `/resources/how-to-choose-aluminum-roofing-sheet`
        - `/blog/aluminum-vs-galvanized-roofing` etc.

6. **Map 1 main keyword per page**
    - Avoid having several pages target the exact same core keyword.
    - Example assignments (for Lagos + Nigeria):
        - Home: "aluminum roofing sheet manufacturer in Lagos" + brand.
        - `/aluminum-roofing-sheets`: "aluminum roofing sheet" + variants ("aluminium roofing sheet", "aluminium roofing sheets price")
        - Product pages: "[profile] aluminum roofing sheet", "0.45mm aluminum roofing sheet", etc.
        - `/applications/residential-roofing`: "aluminum roofing sheet for houses" or similar.

## Phase 2 – Keyword Research (Day 3–4)

7. **Gather seed keywords**

    - Brainstorm first:
        - aluminum roofing sheet
        - aluminium roofing sheet price
        - aluminium roofing sheet thickness 0.45mm, 0.55mm
        - stone coated aluminium roofing sheet
        - aluminum roofing sheet vs galvanised sheet
    - best roofing sheet for hot climate

    - Look for:
        - Search volume.
        - Variations and questions ("People also ask" style queries).

9. **Use ChatGPT “deep research” for each topic**

    - For each seed keyword, run prompts like:
        - "Act as an SEO researcher. Analyze search intent, subtopics, and common questions for the keyword 'aluminum roofing sheet price in Lagos'. Provide: (1) user personas, (2) problems they want to solve, (3) 10 long‑tail keyword ideas, (4) outline for a 1500‑word guide."
        - "List 20 blog topics around 'aluminum roofing sheets' targeting homeowners and contractors in Nigeria (with special focus on Lagos). Group them by awareness level: informational, comparison, purchase‑ready."
    - Save results and choose:
        - 1 primary keyword per page.
        - 3–5 secondary keywords per page.

10. **Create a keyword → page map document**
    - Simple table (can live in Notion, Sheets, or another markdown file):
        - URL | Page Type | Primary Keyword | Secondary Keywords | Intent (Info/Comparison/Transactional)

        -   Add well‑structured headings and paragraphs.
        -   Keep one clear H1 per page.
        -   Use descriptive internal links ("see our aluminum roofing profiles" not "click here").

## Phase 4 – Resources / Documentation Pages (Week 2–3)

15. **Create a `/resources` section**

        -   "Outline an in‑depth 2000‑word guide on 'How to Choose the Right Aluminum Roofing Sheet Thickness for Your House'. Include H2/H3s, FAQs, and internal link suggestions to product and pricing pages."
        -   Then refine the outline before writing.

17. **Write and publish at least 1–2 guides per week** until the initial 5–10 are live.
    -   Each guide:
        -   1500–2500 words.
        -   Clear intro, logical sections, examples, simple math where needed.

## How to Use This Document with ChatGPT

-   Before each big task (e.g. writing a guide, planning a month of blogs), copy the relevant section of this plan into ChatGPT and say:
    -   "Help me execute Step 16 for my aluminum roofing sheet website based in Lagos but serving all of Nigeria. Ask any clarifying questions first, then provide an outline and research notes."
-   Use ChatGPT’s deep research style prompts to:
    -   Expand keyword lists.
    -   Generate detailed outlines.
    -   Draft FAQs and checklists.
-   Keep all decisions (chosen topics, keywords, outlines) in one place (this file, a second `calendar` file, or a spreadsheet) so you stay organized over time.

Follow the phases in order: 0 → 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5, while Phase 5 (blogging) and Phase 7 (review) continue indefinitely.
